      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details / Background</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The Restaurant Database Management System project emerged from a relational Database Management class during my
          undergraduate studies at NMAM Institute of Technology. Throughout the course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of
          database concepts, design principles, and query optimization techniques.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Motivated by a desire to apply my knowledge in a practical setting, I identified a local restaurant facing challenges
          with their manual management processes. Recognizing the potential to make a tangible impact, I embarked on developing a
          tailored solution that would simplify their operations and optimize data management.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Drawing on my expertise in database design, I crafted the Restaurant Database Management System. While it may not have
          been the most complex system, it encompassed enough features to effectively assist the restaurant. The system allowed
          for the storage and organization of crucial information such as menus, reservations, orders, inventory, and customer
          details.</div>
          <div class="body-text">To ensure usability and efficiency, I implemented optimized query techniques and fine-tuned the system's performance. By
          leveraging my knowledge of query optimization and indexing, I improved response times and facilitated quick
          decision-making for the restaurant staff.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Throughout the development process, I actively collaborated with the restaurant staff, gathering their feedback and
          incorporating their specific requirements. This iterative approach allowed me to refine the system, ensuring it provided
          enough features to simplify their operations and enhance their efficiency.</div>
          <div class="body-text">In conclusion, the Restaurant Database Management System project showcases my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to
          real-world challenges. While not the most complex system, it effectively addressed the needs of the local restaurant,
          simplifying their operations and optimizing their data management. This project demonstrates my commitment to delivering
          practical solutions and my ability to develop customized software solutions tailored to specific business requirements.</div>

          <div class="subheader-text">Limitations of the Previous System</div>
          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">The local restaurant faced several limitations and challenges with their manual management processes. These limitations
            included:</div>
            <div class="body-text">1. Time-consuming manual processes for tasks like menu updates, table reservations, order processing, and inventory
            management.</div>
            <div class="body-text">2. Increased risk of human errors in data entry, leading to inaccuracies in orders, inventory, and reservations.</div>
            <div class="body-text">3. Lack of real-time information on table availability, ingredient stocks, and customer preferences, hindering prompt
            customer service.</div>
            <div class="body-text">4. Limited accessibility and analysis of historical data, making it difficult to generate reports and make informed
            decisions.</div>
            <div class="body-text">5. Security vulnerabilities with no proper data protection measures, risking customer privacy and data integrity.</div>
